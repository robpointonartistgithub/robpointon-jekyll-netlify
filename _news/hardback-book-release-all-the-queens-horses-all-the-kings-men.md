### **Artist Residencies with the Household Cavalry and Household Division**

Forward by Sir Chris Ghika KCVO CBE\
Major General Commanding the Household Division 2019-2023

Hardback book 287x250mm, 100 full-colour internal pages

> ###### The format of this book is the story of my personal artistic journey, laying bare the thoughts and experiences of an outsider who is given intimate access to respond to a momentous period in the history of the Royal Family and the British military in London.
>
> ###### I want to give an honest account, a frank insight into how I, a working class English guy from Stoke On Trent with no military connection, became the Artist in Residence for The Household Cavalry and Household Division during the historic transition of a monarch. How did I come to be in a position where I was the only artist with access to paint the restricted Trooping the Colour at Windsor Castle from The Queen’s Private Chambers (the last Trooping the Colour she was able to attend), and an artist who had permission to paint the Lying in State of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as well as The Coronation parades of King Charles III?
