Throughout 2017 and 2018 Rob was Artist in Residence at The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich documenting via oil paintings the Conservation of Sir James Thornhill's masterpiece; The Painted Hall, the biggest conservation project in Europe at that time. Exhibitions of the collection were held inside The Admiral's House and The Old Royal Naval College Visitors Centre.

To celebrate the successful conservation in 2019 a Royal Gala Dinner was held inside the resplendent Painted Hall which Rob painted live throughout and discussed his painting with HRH The Princess Royal at the end of the evening.
