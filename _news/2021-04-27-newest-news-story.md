I have spent a month working on this piece so far, developing pen sketches and small oil paintings to establish the composition and colour palette. It marks a new chapter for me in attempting larger works with compositions dominated by figures. I spent 8 days prior to the dinner painting inside the hall on this large canvas trying to predict the conditions of the evening, table layout, lighting etc.

Of course my guesswork wasnâ€™t that accurate and it took a frantic few hours painting during the dinner to pull my image towards the reality. I shall be returning to work further into the painting in a few weeks time.
