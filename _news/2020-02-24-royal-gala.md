This week I was honoured to have the opportunity to paint the most spectacular dinner celebrating the relaunch of the Painted Hall at The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. The guest of honour was HRH The Princess Royal, who spoke to me briefly and discussed the painting at the end of the evening.

I have spent a month working on this piece so far, developing pen sketches and small oil paintings to establish the composition and colour palette. It marks a new chapter for me in attempting larger works with compositions dominated by figures. I spent 8 days prior to the dinner painting inside the hall on this large canvas trying to predict the conditions of the evening, table layout, lighting etc.

Of course my guesswork wasnâ€™t that accurate and it took a frantic few hours painting during the dinner to pull my image towards the reality. I shall be returning to work further into the painting in a few weeks time.
