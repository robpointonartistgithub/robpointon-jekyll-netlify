At the personal invitation of the Major General Chris Ghika Rob will be painting the Coronation as their official military artist. This will kickstart a 12-month residency with the Household Division, an appointment which follows his hugely successful time as resident artist to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, during which time he covered the final Queenâ€™s Birthday Parade as well as The Queens funeral procession including sketching the lying-in-state inside Westminster Hall.





Rob will be painting The King presenting new Standards and Colours at Buckingham Palace and The Coronation Procession to and from Westminster Abbey.
