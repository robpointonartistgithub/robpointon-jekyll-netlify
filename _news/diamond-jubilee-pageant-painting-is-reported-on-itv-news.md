When he became aware of the plan to sail 1000 boats along the River Thames to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Rob Pointon knew that he had a unique opportunity to create an image of historical importance, which would become a flag ship image for his [year of the boat](http://yearoftheboat.blogspot.co.uk/) project.

To create the Diamond Jubilee Thames Pageant painting Rob spent several days on location prior to the flotilla laying down a foundation depicting the scene. On the day of the Pageant he arrived at 5 am to secure his spot and later added the Union Jacks, the crowds, and of course the boats.

Rob selected the viewpoint to reflect that of the great Canaletto painting, The [River Thames with St. Paul’s Cathedral on Lord Mayors Day](http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/canaletto/the-river-thames-with-st-paul-s-cathedral-on-lord-mayor-s-day) c. 1746 which was created the last time that 1000 craft were brought together in such a way on The Thames. This viewpoint brings a historical reference to Rob’s painting and reflects the countless references to Canaletto’s great painting in the media and social coverage of the event.

The conditions on the day were “challenging to say the least”, the most notable of which was the rain. Fortunately Rob’s chosen medium for the day, oil paint; “thank goodness does not mix with water”.

Another major challenge was the sheer volume of spectators, with this crowd presenting without doubt “the most difficult crowd scene” undertaken to date. Fortunately though Rob is well seasoned regarding painting amongst crowds. His most challenging endeavour in this field prior to the Pageant was undertaken at Weston Park Staffordshire where a series of 3 sold out paintings depict busy crowd scenes at V Festival (2011). These paintings (one of which can be seen [here](http://millardandlancaster.co.uk/rob-pointon/outside-the-arena.html)) encouraged Rob to want to “capture the mood and atmosphere of more live events”, and what better atmosphere than this historically significant event, the Queens Diamond Jubilee Pageant.

Following the excitement of the Pageant Rob now returns to live aboard his narrow boat and continues his [year of the boat project](http://yearoftheboat.blogspot.co.uk/). He will continue to travel the countries waterways where he will produce artwork in a variety of contexts, working entirely from direct observation. His blog includes more information about the project including an itinerary/route and records of his experience so far.
