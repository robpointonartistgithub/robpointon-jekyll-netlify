This guide aims to outline the procedure for viewing and purchasing paintings that are currently available.

Most people require a viewing of any work that they might be interested in and this is something we can comfortably arrange for you at a convenient date, time and location to suit you. All we need to know is which painting’s you are interested in and a few details about where you are located and we will get in touch to offer a viewing at either a nearby location, or, if you wish, we can bring the work to your home if this is more convenient.

Buying a piece of art is a very personal decision, and it has to be completely right for you, so we understand that upon viewing, the painting may not be right for you and wish to re-assure you that arranging a viewing does not place you under any obligation to buy, we want all our collectors to be totally happy with their purchase.

## The process is straightforward

**Choose the work you are interested in** – just make a note of the title so we know which painting you like.

**Contact us by email** – info@robpointon.co.uk with the details of the paintings, your location and your contact details.

Alternatively, you can call us directly to ask any questions you may have and also to arrange viewings. The number to call is 07734 905 327 and you will speak to Karen, who will be happy to discuss arrangements and answer any questions.

For any other enquiries, please email in the first instance on info@robpointon.co.uk
