Rob paints primarily en plein air and has a particular interest in the use of wider angle perspectives and the depiction of movement within his paintings.

Born 1982, Rob Pointon has been painting since he was a child under the tutelage of his artist Grandmother, then, as an adult, graduated with a First Class Honours degree in Fine Art from Aberystwyth University before going on to study at The Royal Drawing School in London. Having been a full time professional artist since 2006, Rob’s skills have developed through his work on locations all around the UK and abroad. Originally from the Staffordshire moorlands Rob is now based in South Cheshire.

Rob is a full member of the ROI (Royal Institute of Oil Painters), a member of MAFA (Manchester Academy of Fine Arts), the British Plein Air Painters and the outdoor painting collective The Northern Boys.

Since 2021 artist residencies with The Household Cavalry and wider Household Division have seen Rob produce a significant body of work around the ceremonial activities of The British Army and the protection of The Royal Households.
