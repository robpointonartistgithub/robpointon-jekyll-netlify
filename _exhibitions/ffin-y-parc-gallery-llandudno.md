'Following two popular and successful shows with us, Rob is back with a new collection of North Wales paintings for the new gallery.

[](<>)These paintings are full of all the speed and noise, bustle and weather swirling about him as he sits and records the world of gulls and umbrellas, wind and dimpled puddles. The things we miss as we hurry to reach the next patch of shelter, or to catch the bus. He watches as the steep, empty streets eagerly break out their colours as the rain clears and the sun gets to dry the tarmac and dazzle the windowsâ€¦

His powers of observation are breathtaking, and the speed with which he can fix the unique, fleeting moment to the canvas in all its quotidian glory is thrilling. You can smell the fumes and the fresh air!

He makes the ordinary, annoying world beautiful, remarkable. Wherever he paints he makes new friends and finds new audiences.'
