The first major solo exhibition of Rob Pointon ROI in London on his 40th year, Panter and Hall Gallery shall present the long awaited exhibition of works as Artist in Residence for The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

The project’s purpose has been to document an extraordinary period in the history of The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. A selection of works have already been on public display inside The Household Cavalry Museum at Horse Guards Parade.

The Residency culminates with a large oil painting of The Platinum Jubilee Trooping of the Colour at Horse Guards Parade in 2022 and shall form a centrepiece to the exhibition along with its counterpart painting of Trooping the Colour 2021 painted from alongside The Queen's private chambers inside the Quadrangle at Windsor Castle.

A percentage of all sales shall be donated to the Household Cavalry Foundation which supports the regiment and it’s veterans.

Please email info@robpointon.co.uk to register interest in the paintings, be added to the mailing list and kept informed of the project.
