The substantial new gallery premises of Ffin y Parc in Llandudno provides the setting for a major Rob Pointon solo exhibition in June 2026.

The exhibition will showcase Rob's fascinating recent departures into dynamic perspectives, inspired by townscapes across Wales, England and launching the collection painted on the steep streets of San Francisco.

Set over 3 floors the exhibition will be the largest in scale and ambition since Rob has been represented by the Welsh Art specialist.
