Ffin y Parc Gallery has fast grown to be one of the most successful art galleries in Wales. This shall be my first exhibition with the gallery after meeting the owner Ralph at Manchester Art Fair in 2019. 

Ralph was drawn to my depiction of movement and unusual perspectives in the urban landscape and this show shall bring that approach to towns and resorts in North Wales.
