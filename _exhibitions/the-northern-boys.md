"These ten distinguished artists, known as The Northern Boys, are united in their shared love of plein air painting"\
\
Though officially formed as a group in 2016, the members were already devoted outdoor oil painters who painted in Europe as well as braving the Great British elements.\
\
A growing recognition of the Northern Boysâ€™ achievements now sees them at the forefront of British plein air painting."
